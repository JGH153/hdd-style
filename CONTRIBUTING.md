# Contributing to hdd-theme

Looking to contribute something to 'Hdd'? **Here's how you can help.**

## Key branches

-   `master` is the latest, deployed version
-   `develop` is the latest, development version

## Pull requests

-   Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changesâ€“keep them simple and small
-   Try to share which browsers your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request

## Committing

To create a new commit please use the `conventional changelog` format.
We have included [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) in this package for the creating of commit messages. You could use `git cz` or `npm run commit` to start creating a new commit.

You can find [here](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md) some examples of how a `conventional changelog` looks like.

## Naming guidlines

The project follows strict naming guidelines. You can read more about them on the [wiki](https://github.com/hafslundnett/hdd-theme/wiki/Naming-guidelines).
