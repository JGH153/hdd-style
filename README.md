'Hafslund digital designsystem' is a design system that can be used across projects while maintaining consistancy. The project follows strict naming guidlines, your can read more about them in the [wiki](https://github.com/hafslundnett/hdd-theme/wiki/Naming-guidelines). Every component should be able to run in an isolated environment without depending on parent classes/elements.

For every used front-end framework a separate 'components' library should be created. Listed below are the already existing libraries. If you want to add your library to this list, please create a pull request.

## Releasing new versions and updating CDN

Azure CDN is used to host fonts and icons from the `cdn/` folder. To update the contents of 

1. Check in the new files under `cdn/`.
2. If this will be included in a new version of the package: Update the package version in `package.json` and the CDN-url in `variables/fontawesome/_variables.scss`. The three numbers after "hdd-style-release-" should match the package version. If the package version is 1.0.2, then the url bound to `$fa-font-path` should be `https://hafslundnett.azureedge.net/hdd-style-release-1-0-2/icons`.
3. Check in and get your pull request accepted into develop.
4. Create a new release-branch and push it to GitHub. The name of the branch should be on the format `release/1.0.2`, given that the package version is 1.0.2. This will start the hdd-style.release build, and upload the contents of `cdn/` to Azure CDN.
5. Continue to release the new version of hdd-style by packaging and uploading the new version to npm manually.
6. When everything is ok, merge the release-branch into master, and draft a new release on GitHub.
