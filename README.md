'Hafslund digital designsystem' is a design system that can be used across projects while maintaining consistancy. The project follows the [BEM naming](http://getbem.com/naming) guide and consists out of components. Every component should be able to run in a isolated environment.

For every front-end framework a separate 'components' library should be created. Listed below are the already existing libraries. If you want to add your library to this list, please create a pull request.
